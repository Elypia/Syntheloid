## About
Synthaloid is a project we'd like to make to to make it easier and better to synthesize
the human voice. Little research has been done on our part with how we'll achieve this 
but for the time being we're just recording some audio recordings of us reading Wikipedia
articles for reference assuming we opt for a machine learning approach so we can later
transcribe these and use them for training.

This may not be the approach we opt for but it is assumed they will the audio recordings
and transcriptions will be used one way or another. Regardless all audio recordings
and transcriptions will be available under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 
license as derivitive work from the original Wikipedia articles.

This many any and all recordings can be used for other projects or research purposes
free of charge.

## Motiviation
The primary motivation is to try relieve the need of voice actors from game development
and short animations by people able to entirely rely on synthesized voices to a reasonable
extent. Our goal is not to sound one to one to a human voice, but coupled with some background
music and ambient sounds, at least sound a little nautral to listen too, just without as much emotion.
