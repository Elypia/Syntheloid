## About
Synthaloid is a project we'd like to create to synthesize the human voice for 
things like game development, music, or animation. 
Little research has been done on our part with how we'll achieve this 
but for the time being we're just recording some audio of us reading Wikipedia
articles for reference assuming we're going to need a dataset.

## Motivation
The primary motivation is to try to relieve the need of voice actors from game development
and short animations by being able to entirely rely on synthesized voices to a reasonable
extent. Our goal is ideally to be indistinguishable to a real human voice, or if not, at least when
be hard to tell apart when obscured with background music and ambient sounds, 
and feel natural to listen to.
